*Options Data Visualization*

Options are contracts that give the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell a stock at a set price before a deadline; allows traders to leverage positions with limited upfront cost. Options chains contain multivariate data (strikes, expiration, Greeks, volume, open interest, etc) that is difficult to interpret in tabular format.  Traders struggle to identify patterns and profitable opportunities: only ~10% of traders make money. Our goal will be to create a series of pivotal, insightful, and impactful visualizations that allow traders to make more informed decisions regarding the options contract(s) in which they are investing to maximize the return and mitigate the risk.

## Project Type

Tool and data presentation

## Questions of interest

*How can visualizing options chain data improve a traderâ€™s ability to identify profitable strategies?*

*How can visualizing options strategies mitigate risk?*

*How can time-varying (dynamic) options chains provide greater insight?*

## Goal 

Web-app (streamlit) or interface that allows users to upload a dataframe (e.g. csv) of a single or multiple options chains and automatically generate visuals for their data. This web-app will be deployed and hosted using streamlit's free service through our public git repo.
